## 🚀 Step-by-Step Submission Process

### Step 1: Regenerate Figures (Optional)

If you want to regenerate figures with your actual data:

```bash
cd /path/to/package
python generate_figures.py
```

This creates all 7 figures in both PDF and PNG formats.

### Step 2: Compile LaTeX Paper

```bash
# First compilation
pdflatex main.tex

# Generate bibliography
bibtex main

# Final compilations
pdflatex main.tex
pdflatex main.tex
```

You should get `main.pdf` (~20-25 pages).

### Step 3: Submit to arXiv

1. Go to https://arxiv.org/submit
2. Upload these files:
   - `main.tex`
   - All PDF figures from `figures/` folder
   - Any `.bbl` file generated by bibtex
3. Select category: **cs.CR** (Cryptography and Security) or **cs.NI** (Networking)
4. Add comment: "Submitted to Ad Hoc Networks (Elsevier)"
5. Submit and wait for moderation (~1 business day)
6. Note your arXiv ID (e.g., arXiv:2025.XXXXX)

### Step 4: Submit to Ad Hoc Networks

1. Go to https://www.editorialmanager.com/adhoc/
2. Create account / log in
3. Click "Submit New Manuscript"
4. Article Type: "Full Length Article"
5. Upload:
   - `main.tex` (or `main.pdf` if requested)
   - All figures separately
   - Cover letter mentioning arXiv preprint
6. Add keywords: Mobile ad hoc networks, Denial-of-service, XGBoost, NS-3
7. Suggest 3-5 reviewers (optional but helps)
8. Submit

## 📝 Cover Letter Template (for Journal)

```
Dear Editor,

We are pleased to submit our manuscript titled "DoS Attack Detection in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks: A Machine Learning Approach with Leakage-Free Evaluation" for consideration in Ad Hoc Networks.

This work addresses denial-of-service detection in MANETs using rigorous, leakage-free machine learning evaluation. Our XGBoost-based approach achieves 94.7% multiclass accuracy and 96.7% binary accuracy with ROC-AUC of 0.994. We provide comprehensive methodological transparency, including public release of all code and data at https://github.com/vssk18/manet-ids.

An arXiv preprint is available at: arXiv:2025.XXXXX

We believe this work is well-suited for Ad Hoc Networks given its focus on MANET security and will be of interest to the network security community.

All authors have approved the manuscript and agree with submission to Ad Hoc Networks.

Sincerely,
Varanasi Sai Srinivasa Karthik
On behalf of all authors
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### LaTeX won't compile?
- Install missing packages: `sudo apt-get install texlive-full`
- Or use Overleaf (upload all files)

### Figures not showing?
- Check figure paths in `\includegraphics{}`
- Ensure figures folder is in same directory as main.tex

### arXiv rejected submission?
- Check file size (< 10MB total)
- Ensure no proprietary fonts
- Remove any external file dependencies
